                            The journey through our inner world is sacred and individual. It will only be truly known to oneself. We offer a method of understanding and connecting with our inner world which we call Integrative Self Analysis. We start with the notion that every human is made up of three distinct selves. There is a low self, middle self and high self. The ‘low,’ ‘middle,’ and ‘high’ are references to states of consciousness, not labels or judgments of ‘better’ or ‘lesser.’ The low self resides and operates largely at a subconscious level. The middle self operates mainly at a conscious level, while the high self operates at a level above ordinary consciousness, or superconscious. Briefly put, the low self is responsible for intuition and feeling; we use our middle self for focus thinking; the high self has connection to divinity, oneness as well as contracts and agreements with other high selves for lessons on the Earth plane.

                            {<br />}


                             In the vast experiences of a lifetime, people feel various states of flow, synchronicity, and clear intuition.  These moments are when our middle self and low self have aligned and our high self is then able to be drawn into our being. When the middle self and low self are in dissonance, the vibration is not sufficient to allow the high self to come in. Our path is focused on cultivating a loving, understanding, and communicative relationship between our selves.  This inner work is much like caring for a garden. There is only one task to accomplish, care for the garden.

                            This method of self care borrows and integrates with psychological and spiritual knowledge from many paths. Much of the structure of the selves comes from Max Freedom Long's Huna Method (which was claimed to be knowledge from the Ancient Kahunas in Hawaii). The experiential knowledge of this work comes from over 40 years of personal experience from Ralph 'Corky' Matson. In that time, he has shared this insight and learned from hundreds of practitioners in all walks of life.
